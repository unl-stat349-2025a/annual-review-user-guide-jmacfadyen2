  abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

  abstract = {The value of research data has grown as the emphasis on research transparency and data-intensive research has increased. Data sharing is now required by funders and publishers and is becoming a disciplinary expectation in many fields. However, practices promoting data reusability and research transparency are poorly understood, making it difficult for statisticians and other researchers to reframe study methods to facilitate data sharing. This article reviews the larger landscape of open research and describes contextual information that data reusers need to understand, evaluate, and appropriately analyze shared data. The article connects data reusability to statistical thinking by considering the impact of the type and quality of shared research artifacts on the capacity to reproduce or replicate studies and examining quality evaluation frameworks to understand the nature of data errors and how they can be mitigated prior to sharing. Actions statisticians can take to update their research approaches for their own and collaborative investigations are suggested.},
