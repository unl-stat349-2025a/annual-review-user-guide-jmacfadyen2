# Understanding FAIR Principles {.unnumbered}

## What Are FAIR Principles?

### Findable

Data should be easy to locate, both by humans and machines. By using
descriptive metadata, unique identifiers (e.g., DOIs), clear file naming
conventions, and proper repository setup, your data will be able to be
shared and used by anyone who needs it.

### Accessible

Data should be able to be available to anyone who needs it with minimal
restrictions. This is done by using open-access repositories and
providing clear instructions for accessing the data.

### Interoperable

Data should be structured in a way in which it can be easily integrated
with other data and tools for analysis, storage, and processing. This
involves standardized and non-proprietary formats and consistent
vocabulary.

### Reusable

Data should be well-documented and licensed in a way that allows others
to use it for new purposes. This includes providing context (e.g.,
metadata), methodology, and clear terms of use.

## Why FAIR Matters

In order to achieve a transparent, collaborative research environment,
researchers must adhere to FAIR principles. Having FAIR data makes it
easier for others to verify and reproduce your findings, which
strengthens your research as a whole. It enables others to build upon
your work, and allows your research to be better shared within and
across disciplines. Not only this, but many funding agencies and
journals now require researchers to share their data in accordance with
FAIR principles.

## How To Achieve FAIR Data

After learning what FAIR principles are and why they matter, we can now learn important tools in achieving FAIR data. Some crucial things you must do include creating [metadata](metadata-guide.qmd), a [README file](readme-guide.qmd), and working with [repositories and version control](version-control-guide.qmd). The rest of this guide will cover these steps more in-depth.
