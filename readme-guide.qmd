# Making a README File

## README Files

A README file is a crucial document in data sharing, as it provides
essential information about a project, dataset, or collection of files.
It serves as both a guide and documentation to help users understand the
purpose, structure, and usage fo the file it describes. Even if some
information is available elsewhere, consolidating it in the README
ensures clarity and accessibility. This redundancy is helpful not only
for others but also for you, as you may revisit the data in the future.

This guide will walk you through the steps to create an effective README
file for a dataset or project. You can also search for README templates
to speed up the process, but it's important they include what's covered
below and are appropriate for your research and data.

## Formatting and Structure

1.  **Use Plain Text**
    -   Write your README as a plain text file (.txt) to ensure
        compatibility across all platforms.
    -   Avoid proprietary formats like MS Word, as they may cause
        compatibility issues.
2.  **Structure for Readability**
    -   Use headings and subheadings to organize sections.
    -   Separate sections with blank lines to improve readability.
    -   Write in clear, concise language, providing enough detail for
        users to understand and reuse the data.
3.  **Additional Information**
    -   **Table of Contents**: For a longer README file, include a table
        of contents to help users navigate the document.
    -   **Keywords**: If your work or discipline uses scientific naming
        conventions, use them consistently throughout the README file.
    -   **Multiple README Files**: If you are creating multiple README
        files for various related datasets, maintain a consistent
        structure and format across all files.

## Essential Information to Include

1.  **Title**
    -   All README files should open with a clear and concise title for
        the project or dataset. This will ensure that whoever opens the
        file knows exactly what it is about.
2.  **Credits**
    -   List the names of all key contributors to the project or
        dataset.
    -   Include contact information (e.g., email addresses) for the
        principal investigator or main contact person to allow users to
        reach out with questions.
3.  **Date of Data Collection**
    -   When describing a dataset, include the date in which it was
        collected. Use the ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD).
4.  **Location of Data Collection**
    -   When describing a dataset, include the geographic location in
        which the data was collected. Be as precise as possible.

## Data Overview

1.  **File Names and Descriptions**
    -   List the names of all files described in the README.
    -   Provide a short description of the data contained in each file.
    -   Specify the file format if it is not obvious from the file name.
    -   Include the date the file was created and any versioning
        information.

2.  **Multiple Files**
    -   If the README file is describing multiple related files, explain
        how they are connected.
3.  **Additional Information**
    -   If multiple files share a naming convention or include
        abbreviations, explain it.
    -   If there is any other additional information that you think will
        help the reader better understand the data, include it.

### Data-Specific Information

1.  **Variable List**
    -   Provide a count of the number of variables as well as
        cases/rows/observations in the dataset.
    -   List all variables, codes, or abbreviations used in the data,
        along with their definitions.
2.  **Units of Measurement**
    -   Specify the units of measurement for each variable.
3.  **Missing Data Codes**
    -   Define any codes or symbols used to represent missing or
        incomplete data (e.g., "NA" or "99").

## Data Collection and Methodology

1.  **Data Collection Methods**
    -   Describe the methods used to collect or generate the data.
        Include links to protocols or publications used, if available.
2.  **Data Processing**
    -   Explain how the data was processed from raw to final form. Did
        you clean or transform the data? If so, describe the steps.
    -   List any software, tools, or scripts used for processing,
        including version numbers.
3.  **Quality Assurance**
    -   Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data.
    -   Note any data that was omitted or flagged as low quality.
4.  **Additional Information**
    -   If there is any other additional information that you think will
        help the reader better understand the data, include it.

## Sharing and Access Information

1.  **Licenses or Restrictions**
    -   Specify any licenses or restrictions on the use of the data.
2.  **Recommend Citation**
    -   Provide a recommended citation format for the dataset.
3.  **Links to Publications or Repositories**
    -   Include links to publications that cite or use the data.
    -   If the data is hosted in a repository, provide the URL.
